# 🫧 Empty-State Messages (with Companion)

Below are **ready-to-ship examples**.

---

## 1️⃣ No Entries Yet (First Launch)

**Headline**

> Welcome to Jellit

**Body**

> This is a quiet place to notice patterns over time.
> There’s nothing to fix — just observe.

**CTA**

> Add first entry

🧠 *Companion appears smiling, neutral posture*

---

## 2️⃣ No Entry Today

**Headline**

> Nothing logged today

**Body**

> That’s okay.
> Not every day needs a note.

**CTA**

> Log now

🧠 *Companion relaxed, sitting*

---

## 3️⃣ Empty Dashboard (New User, No Data)

**Headline**

> Your patterns will show up here

**Body**

> After a few entries, you’ll start seeing trends.
> There’s no rush.

🧠 *Companion pointing gently toward chart placeholder*

---

## 4️⃣ No Data This Week

**Headline**

> A quiet week

**Body**

> When you’re ready, pick up where you left off.
> Your body doesn’t keep score.

🧠 *Companion calm, neutral*

---

## 5️⃣ First Logged Entry Confirmation

**Toast / Inline Message**

> Noted.

*(That’s it. No companion needed here.)*

---

## 6️⃣ Weekly Summary — Very Little Data

**Headline**

> This week, at a glance

**Body**

> There’s not much here yet — and that’s normal.
> Patterns take time.

🧠 *Companion present, small scale*

---

## 7️⃣ Long Gap Since Last Entry

**Headline**

> Welcome back

**Body**

> You can continue anytime.
> Nothing was lost.

**CTA**

> Log entry

🧠 *Companion friendly, non-reactive*

---

# 🧭 Summary Insight Copy (Optional but Powerful)

Use **one line max** under charts.

Examples:

* “Variation like this is common.”
* “Over time, timing tends to become clearer.”
* “Comfort looks fairly steady.”

These lines do **emotional work** that charts can’t.

---

## Internal Guardrail (Pin This)

> **If a sentence could make a user feel judged, rushed, or monitored — delete it.**
