# 🌱 Jellit — Design & Tone Principles (Revised)

## 1. Calm, Friendly, and Human

Jellit should feel like a **quiet companion**, not a clinician or a gadget.

* Language is **simple, warm, and reassuring**
* No medical jargon unless strictly necessary
* The app acknowledges the user gently, without judgment

**Vibe:** someone who’s paying attention, not taking notes.

---

## 2. Lightness Without Jokes

Jellit avoids humor, sarcasm, or punchlines — but it is never cold.

* Lightness comes from **kind phrasing, soft visuals, and friendly presence**
* Subtle smiles, rounded shapes, and gentle animations are welcome
* Nothing crude, graphic, or childish

**Rule:** If it would feel out of place in a calm wellness space, it doesn’t belong.

## 3. The Companion as a Quiet Presence

The Jellit companion (based on the attached logo style) represents:

* Calm
* Comfort
* Everyday normality

The companion:

* Does **not** react dramatically to entries
* Does **not** comment on specifics (no stool jokes, no exaggeration)
* Appears sparingly: empty states, summaries, gentle confirmations

**Tone examples:**

* “Noted.”
* “Thanks for checking in.”
* “Bodies have their rhythms.”

The companion never steals focus — it supports it.

## 4. Reassurance Over Analysis

Insights are framed to **reduce anxiety**, not increase vigilance.

* Emphasize patterns over individual events
* Use neutral, comforting language for variability
* Normalize fluctuations whenever possible

**Instead of:** “Irregular pattern detected”
**Prefer:** “Your timing has varied a bit recently — that’s common.”

---

## 5. No Pressure, No Performance

Jellit does not push productivity metaphors onto the body.

* No streaks
* No guilt-based reminders
* No “missed days” framing

Progress is acknowledged quietly:

* “You’ve been building a useful record.”
* “Over time, patterns become clearer.”

---

## 6. Visual Softness by Default

The interface should feel **approachable and safe** at first glance.

* Rounded shapes over sharp edges
* Soft, natural colors
* Gentle motion over static rigidity

The app should feel friendly **even when there is no data**.

---

## 7. Respectful Silence Is a Feature

Jellit knows when not to speak.

* No excessive notifications
* No constant prompts
* No unnecessary commentary

The user should feel **in control**, not monitored.

---

## Guiding Sentence (Internal North Star)

> **Serious about health. Gentle about being human.**
