# ✅ Jellit — Design System Checklist

Use this as a **PR / design review gate**. If a screen fails multiple checks, it doesn’t ship.

---

## 1. Visual Tone

* [ ] First impression feels calm, not clinical
* [ ] Screen would not look out of place in a meditation app
* [ ] No pure white or medical gray backgrounds
* [ ] Overall contrast is soft, readable, and non-aggressive

---

## 2. Color & Gradients

* [ ] Backgrounds use off-white or tinted neutrals
* [ ] Primary colors are cool (mint, teal, soft blue)
* [ ] Gradients are subtle and low-saturation
* [ ] Gradients are never applied to text or charts
* [ ] No warning red unless medically critical (almost never)

---

## 3. Layout & Spacing

* [ ] Generous vertical spacing between sections
* [ ] No table-like layouts
* [ ] Dividers replaced by spacing, cards, or color shifts
* [ ] Screen does not feel dense or compressed

---

## 4. Cards & Surfaces

* [ ] Cards have large rounded corners (16–24px)
* [ ] Cards either float (shadow) OR separate by color — not both
* [ ] Shadows are soft, wide, and low opacity
* [ ] No hard borders around primary surfaces

---

## 5. Typography

* [ ] Rounded or humanist sans-serif
* [ ] Medium weight used as default
* [ ] Headlines feel calm, not assertive
* [ ] No ALL CAPS
* [ ] Comfortable line height for slow reading

---

## 6. Motion & Interaction

* [ ] Animations are slow and gentle
* [ ] Components fade or float in subtly
* [ ] Tap interactions scale softly (no bounce)
* [ ] Motion never demands attention
* [ ] Nothing feels “snappy” or “energetic”

---

## 7. Charts & Data

* [ ] Charts use muted colors
* [ ] Lines are rounded
* [ ] No sharp spikes emphasized visually
* [ ] Every chart includes a calming interpretive line
* [ ] Charts feel observational, not diagnostic

---

## 8. Companion Usage

* [ ] Companion appears only in empty or summary states
* [ ] Companion never overlaps data
* [ ] Companion expression is calm and neutral
* [ ] Companion copy follows tone guidelines

---

## 9. Empty States

* [ ] Empty states feel intentional, not broken
* [ ] Use gradients, spacing, and calm copy
* [ ] Encourage without pressure or urgency
* [ ] No “missing data” language

---

## 10. Removal Check (Mandatory)

Before finalizing:

* [ ] Can one element be removed?
* [ ] Is any element trying too hard to explain?
* [ ] Is this screen calmer with less?

If yes → remove it.
